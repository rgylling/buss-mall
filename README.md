buss-mall app

BusMall wants a web app that shows potential products to individuals in focus groups, three products at a time.Your web page should show three randomly selected product images and let users select the product they'd be most likely to purchase out of the three images, then repeat for a total of 16 selections.To keep the marketing analysis unbiased, do not show voting results before all 16 votes have been cast; even after 16 votes, do not automatically show the results; instead, BusMall wants you to show two buttons on the page: one to show voting results, the other to let the user vote 8 more times then show results automatically after the 8th additional vote.
